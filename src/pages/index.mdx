Hey, I'm Parker. Welcome to my Digital Domain! I recently graduated from Seattle Pacific University where I studied Computer Science, Applied Math, and Data Analytics. Now, I'm working as a Fullstack Software Engineer at Smartsheet, using technologies like React, TypeScript, and Kotlin. I also enjoy building personal projects: I'm currently building [knowted](https://knowted.app), a student participation tracking application for course instructors. You can read more about me on my [About page](/about).

The term _Digital Domain_ stems primarily from the phrase ["digital garden."](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) This site serves as _my_ digital garden, though I've personalized the concept to suit an old nickname of mine. In high school, many of my friends called me **"Lord Parker"**. Thus, as one might tend to their garden, I tend to my territory... my _domain_.

The connotation of _Digital Domain_ captures the nature of my relationship to this site, too. As the benevolent lord of this land, I aim to write freely and abundantly here. Everything you see is a product of my own pursuits and passions. I rule the content of this site and command its trajectory.
