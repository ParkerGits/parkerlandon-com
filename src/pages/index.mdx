title: "Welcome ðŸ‘‹"

Hey, I'm Parker! I'm a senior at Seattle Pacific University studying Computer Science, Applied Math, and Data Analytics, and I'm a self-taught fullstack web developer. Welcome to my Digital Domain! You can read more about me on my [about page](/about).

The term _Digital Domain_ stems firstly from the phrase ["digital garden."](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) Effectively, this site serves as _my_ digital garden. The only difference is that I've personalized the concept to suit an old nickname of mine. In high school, many of my friends called me **"Lord Parker"** (you can read about that here). Thus, as one might tend to their garden, I tend to my territory... my _domain_.

The notion of a _Digital Domain_ also characterizes my relationship to the content on this site. As the benevolent lord of this land, I aim to write freely and abundantly here. Everything you see is a product of my own pursuits and passions. I rule the content of this site. I dictate the trajectory of my Digital Domain.

If you are interested in my journey, connect with me on my social media via the footer links below! Otherwise, check out all of my posts [here](/posts) or my portfolio [here](/portfolio).
