Hey, I'm Parker! I'm a senior at Seattle Pacific University studying Computer Science, Applied Math, and Data Analytics, and I'm a self-taught fullstack developer. Welcome to my Digital Domain! You can read more about me on my [about page](/about).

The term _Digital Domain_ stems firstly from the phrase ["digital garden."](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) Effectively, this site serves as _my_ digital garden, with the only difference being that I've personalized the concept to suit an old nickname of mine. In high school, many of my friends called me **"Lord Parker"**. Thus, as one might tend to their garden, I tend to my territory... my _domain_.

The connotation of  _Digital Domain_ also captures the nature of my relationship to this site. As the benevolent lord of this land, I aim to write freely and abundantly here. Everything you see is a product of my own pursuits and passions. I rule the content of this site. I dictate the trajectory of my Digital Domain.

If you are interested in my journey, connect with me on my social media via the footer links below! Otherwise, check out all of my posts [here](/posts) or my portfolio [here](/portfolio).
