Users could log into the service via GitHub or Google and create the quantities they wanted to track.

I use bitwise operations to convert binary strings to ASCII characters before outputting the encoded message and a string representation of the tree to a file. To decode the message, the embedded Huffman Tree is parsed and reconstructed from the encoded message. While I cannot share my code for this lab (it is still an assessment tool), I have provided pictures and my final grade report.

The team I belonged to, Content Solutions, was primarily focused on developing the platform\'s "proofing" feature, which streamlines the iterative process of content creation by facilitating document versioning, feedback requests, and comments. My task over the summer was to implement a "due dates" feature for feedback requests to give requestors a better sense of when to expect recipient feedback. Before initiating the development work, I drafted a systems design document to receive feedback and continuously iterated on my plan. Once I was confident in my approach, I implemented the frontend components with TypeScript, React, Redux, and SASS, used Java Spring and MySQL to build the backend functionality, and used Docker to manage microservices during development. At the end of my internship, I presented the feature in a meeting open to all product development employees. Throughout this experience, I collaborated with managers, designers, user-experience researchers, and other engineers across all of Smartsheet\'s product development teams.',
