Like other vertical social platforms such as Goodreads for books and Letterboxd for movies, hngr provides a social space for foodies to share and discover restaurant experiences. I was the sole developer of hngr for the first four months, implementing the groundwork features and architecture for the application. Now, I lead three other developers on the project as manager and scrummaster; we meet for standup three times weekly and work in 2-week sprints. We've implemented hngr with Expo (React Native) and TypeScript on the frontend, Node.js with TypeScript and Express on the backend, and services like Planetscale to store app data and the Foursquare Places API for restaurant data. The team plans to launch hngr to our waitlist of users sometime in the winter or spring. ",

By integrating with the popular Canvas Learning Management System, Knowted centralizes student data with a dashboard and facilitates the quick and systematic selection of students for participation. Knowted enables professors to effortlessly grade student interactions and export those grades to the grade book. The application already benefits instructors as it sees growing usage among professors at Seattle Pacific University. The next step of this project is to expand beyond Seattle Pacific University and support instructors at other institutions.",

I use bitwise operations to convert binary strings to ASCII characters before outputting the encoded message and a string representation of the tree to a file. To decode the message, the embedded Huffman Tree is parsed and reconstructed from the encoded message. While I cannot share my code for this lab (it is still an assessment tool), I have provided pictures and my final grade report. This project represents the culmination of my C++ coursework and demonstrates my understanding of data structures and object-oriented programming.",

      'For ten weeks during the summer of 2022, I worked at Smartsheet as a full-time software engineering intern. The team I belonged to, Content Solutions, was primarily focused on developing the platform\'s "proofing" feature, which streamlines the iterative process of content creation by facilitating document versioning, feedback requests, and comments. My task over the summer was to implement a "due dates" feature for feedback requests to give requestors a better sense of when to expect recipient feedback. Before initiating the development work, I drafted a systems design document to receive feedback and continuously iterated on my plan. Once I was confident in my approach, I implemented the frontend components with TypeScript, React, Redux, and SASS, used Java Spring and MySQL to build the backend functionality, and used Docker to manage microservices during development. At the end of my internship, I presented the feature in a meeting open to all product development employees. Throughout this experience, I collaborated with managers, designers, user-experience researchers, and other engineers across all of Smartsheet\'s product development teams.',
